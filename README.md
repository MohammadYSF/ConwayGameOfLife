The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.
One of the applications of this game is to analyze the complex systems ; systems in which its particles behavior is dependent on the behavior of other particles ( in the game of life , that is neighbors)
